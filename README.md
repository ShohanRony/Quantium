## Project Overview

This project analyzes the impact of a retail trial by comparing a trial store (where the trial was conducted) with a control store (a similar store not part of the trial). The goal is to determine whether the trial had a statistically significant effect on key performance metrics such as total sales and number of customers. The analysis involves selecting the most suitable control store, scaling its performance to match the trial store's pre-trial data, and assessing the trial's impact using statistical methods like t-tests and confidence intervals.
Key Features

    Control Store Selection: Uses correlation and magnitude distance to identify the most similar control store.

    Performance Scaling: Scales the control store's sales and customer counts to match the trial store's pre-trial performance.

    Statistical Analysis: Calculates percentage differences and uses t-values and confidence intervals to assess the trial's impact.

    Visualizations: Provides clear visualizations of trends in sales and customer counts for the trial store, control store, and other stores.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Preparation**

    Load and preprocess the dataset.

    Create a YEARMONTH column for time-based analysis.

    Calculate key metrics (e.g., total sales, number of customers) for each store and month.

2. **Control Store Selection**

    Filter stores with complete pre-trial data.

    Calculate correlation and magnitude distance to identify the most similar control store.

    Combine scores to create a composite score for ranking control stores.

3. **Trend Visualization**

    Plot trends in total sales and number of customers for the trial store, control store, and other stores.

    Visualize pre-trial and trial period trends to assess similarity.

4. **Trial Impact Assessment**

    Scale the control store's performance to match the trial store's pre-trial performance.

    Calculate the percentage difference between the trial store and the scaled control store.

    Use t-values and confidence intervals to determine statistical significance.

5. **Statistical Significance
**
    Calculate the standard deviation of percentage differences during the pre-trial period.

    Compute t-values for the trial months and compare them to the 95th percentile of the t-distribution.

    Visualize results with confidence intervals to highlight significant differences.

        Review the control store selection process.

        Analyze trends in sales and customer counts.

        Assess the trial's impact using statistical results and visualizations.

## Key Insights

    Control Store Selection: The control store is selected based on its similarity to the trial store in terms of pre-trial performance.

    Trial Impact: The trial's impact is assessed by comparing the trial store's performance to the scaled control store's performance.

    Statistical Significance: t-values and confidence intervals are used to determine whether the trial had a statistically significant effect.
